1.  **Declarative Title:** Donidalorsen administered every 4 or 8 weeks reduces hereditary angioedema attack rate in patients with hereditary angioedema


2.  **Background:**
    *   Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a chronic, rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the *SERPING1* gene, which encodes the C1 inhibitor protein.
    *  This leads to either a deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor protein, which is a major regulator of multiple proteases including factor XII. When C1 inhibitor function is lost, this leads to uncontrolled activation of plasma prekallikrein, which then leads to activation of bradykinin, a powerful vasodilator.
    *   Bradykinin induced vasodilation increases vascular permeability, leading to episodes of swelling, pain, and potentially life-threatening HAE attacks, which severely affects a patient's quality of life.
    *   Current management guidelines recommend long-term prophylaxis with various agents, but breakthrough attacks can still occur.
    *   Donidalorsen is an investigational antisense oligonucleotide designed to selectively bind to and degrade prekallikrein mRNA in hepatocytes using ribonuclease H1. This leads to a reduction in the production of prekallikrein protein, which is a key precursor in the kallikrein-kinin cascade.
    *   Donidalorsen is designed for delivery to hepatocytes, the main site of prekallikrein production, by conjugating the antisense oligonucleotide with triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) moiety.

5.  **Purpose:**
    *   **Population**: Patients 12 years of age or older with confirmed hereditary angioedema type I or II
    *   **Intervention**: Subcutaneous donidalorsen (80 mg) every 4 or 8 weeks
    *   **Comparison**: Placebo
    *  **Outcome**: Time-normalized number of investigator-confirmed hereditary angioedema attacks per 4 weeks

6.  **Primary predictor variable**:
    *   The primary predictor variable was the administration of donidalorsen at two different dosing intervals (every 4 weeks and every 8 weeks) compared to placebo.

7.  **Primary outcome variable**:
    *   The primary outcome was the time-normalized number of investigator-confirmed hereditary angioedema attacks per 4 weeks (attack rate) from week 1 to week 25.
     * Time normalized rate is defined as the number of events divided by the person-time (number of weeks followed) multiplied by a constant (4 weeks in this case). It is a way to standardize event rate for varying follow up time among participants.

8.  **Secondary outcome variables**:
    *   **Evaluated from weeks 5-25**
        *   Time-normalized attack rate for this time period
        *   Incidence of moderate or severe attacks
        *  Clinical response (defined as ≥50%, ≥70%, or ≥90% reduction in attack rate from baseline)
        *   Number of attacks that led to on-demand therapy
        * Attack-free status
    * **Evaluated from baseline to 25 weeks**
       * Angioedema Quality-of-Life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire
       * score on the Angioedema Control Test (AECT)
    * **Exploratory endpoints**: Evaluated weeks 1-25
      * Number of ED visits
      * reported improvement of PGI-C
      * Plasma Prekallikrein levels

    
9.  **Study design**:
    *   This was a phase 3, multinational, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
    *   **Double-blind:** Neither the participants nor the researchers knew which treatment (donidalorsen or placebo) the participant was receiving.
    *   **Randomized:** Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either a 4-week dosing interval or an 8-week dosing interval. Within these two groups, participants were randomly assigned again in a 3:1 ratio to receive donidalorsen or placebo.
    *  **Placebo-controlled**: The study had a placebo group to compare to the experimental groups. This is done to determine whether a treatment effect is due to the active drug or a placebo effect.
    *   **Phase 3 Trial**: late-stage clinical trial designed to confirm the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing of a treatment in a larger patient population.

10. **Level of evidence**:
    *   Level 1B. Therapeutic study. Randomized controlled trial.

11. **Methodology:**
    *   **Patient Recruitment:**
        *   Patients 12 years or older with confirmed hereditary angioedema type I or II were recruited across multiple sites
        *   Inclusion criteria:
            *   At least two investigator-confirmed HAE attacks during the run-in period (56 days to 1 day before randomization).
        *   Exclusion criteria: not listed in summary (see supplementary appendix)
    *   **Data Collection**:
        *   Data on the number of investigator-confirmed HAE attacks was collected prospectively
        *   The Angioedema Quality-of-Life (AE-QoL) Questionnaire was used, which consists of 17 items and 4 domains (functioning, fatigue/mood, fears/shame, and nutrition). Within each domain, items are scored from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating attacks that occur more frequently or have a worse effect. Raw scores for each domain and the total score are calculated and transformed into a linear scale that ranges from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 indicating the worst possible quality of life.
        * The Angioedema Control Test (AECT) was used, which has scores ranging from 0 to 16, with a score ≥10 indicating well-controlled disease.
        * The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale, which captures change with responses such as much worse, worse, a little worse, no change, a little better, better, and much better.
    *   **Key Procedures**:
        *   Participants were screened for up to 56 days.
        *  Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to either a 4-week dosing interval (the 4-week group) or an 8-week dosing interval (the 8-week group).
         *  Within each dosing-interval group, patients were randomly assigned again, in a 3:1 ratio, to receive donidalorsen or placebo, administered subcutaneously.
         * Trial-site visits occurred at weeks 1 (baseline), 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, and 25 during the treatment period and subsequently at weeks 4, 8, and 13 after the end of the treatment period.

12. **Statistical Methods:**
    *   Statistical power and sample size calculations were determined using simulations based on a generalized linear model assuming a Poisson distribution (because we are counting the number of events).
    *   Sample size chosen with goal to detect 25% lower attack rate in 4-week donidalorsen group compared to placebo
        *   A *Poisson distribution* is a statistical model used to describe the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events occur with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event.
     * The primary endpoint was analyzed using a Poisson regression model that included a categorical fixed effect for trial group, the time-normalized HAE attack rate during the run-in period, interaction of trial group and baseline attack rate as covariates, and the logarithm time per 4 weeks that each patient was observed as an offset variable.
         *   A *Poisson regression model* is a statistical method to model count data. It predicts the rate at which an event occurs, taking into account other variables that might influence it (e.g., baseline attack rate).
         *   A *covariate* is a variable that may have an influence on a dependent variable (in this case number of HAE attacks per 4 weeks). By including covariates such as baseline attack rate, we can account for confounding factors.
        *    An *offset variable* is a variable added to the regression model to adjust for the different lengths of observation across participants (in this case follow-up time, with some participants having longer follow-up times than others)
     * *Pearson Chi-square scaling* was used to account for overdispersion. Overdispersion is when the variance in the data is larger than what is expected from a Poisson distribution.
    *   A *hierarchical testing procedure* was applied to control for multiplicity across 24 end points.
         *  A hierarchical approach means that the statistical tests are ordered, and the conclusions for lower-ranked hypotheses are based on whether earlier tests in the hierarchy are significant. This allows one to prioritize endpoints and to control for overall type I error
    *    Missing data was assumed to be missing at random.

13. **Population details:**
    *   A total of 116 patients were screened and 90 patients were randomized.
    *   45 patients were randomized to the 4-week dosing group, 23 to the 8-week dosing group and 22 to the placebo group.
    *   The mean age of patients was 37 years, with 7 participants under the age of 18 (mean age of the <18 group was 14)
     *  7 (7%) patients had HAE type 2, and the remainder had type 1.
    *   52% had a history of laryngeal attacks
    *   18% had received prophylactic therapy prior to study.
    *   The mean baseline attack rate was 3.61 in the 4-week group, 3.18 in the 8-week group, and 2.9 in the placebo group.
    * The study population is not racially diverse as 82% or more of participants in each group were white. This is a significant limitation.

14. **Results:**
    *   The primary endpoint, the time-normalized attack rate from weeks 1-25, was significantly lower in the 4-week donidalorsen group (0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.73) and 8-week donidalorsen group (1.02; 95% CI, 0.65-1.59) compared to the placebo group (2.26; 95% CI, 1.66-3.09) (P<0.001 and P=0.004, respectively).
    *   The mean attack rate from week 1 to 25 was 81% lower in the 4-week donidalorsen group and 55% lower in the 8-week donidalorsen group compared to the placebo group.
    *   The median reduction in the attack rate from baseline was 90% in the 4-week group, 83% in the 8-week group and 16% in the placebo group.
    *   The mean attack rate from weeks 5 to 25 was 87% lower in the 4-week donidalorsen group and 60% lower in the 8-week donidalorsen group compared to placebo.
    *  82% of patients in the 4-week group had a reduction in attacks of 70% or more from baseline compared to 18% of patients in the placebo group. 53% of patients in the 4-week group remained attack free compared to 9% in the placebo group.
    *   Donidalorsen every 4 weeks was also associated with a significant improvement in the Angioedema Quality-of-Life score compared to placebo (18.6 points).
    *   Patients in the 4 week group also had fewer emergency department visits compared to patients in the placebo group.
    *   By week 5, mean trough circulating prekallikrein concentration had decreased by 46% and 52% in the 4-week and 8-week groups, respectively, compared to essentially no change in the placebo group.

15. **Safety outcomes (if applicable)**:
    *   The most common adverse events were erythema at the injection site, headache, and nasopharyngitis; 98% of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.
    *  There were 5 severe adverse events reported (2 headache, 1 elevated creatinine kinase, 1 epicondylitis, 1 thumb injury), none were related to the study medication
    *  The safety profile was similar across the 4 and 8 week donidalorsen groups.

16. **Key takeaways:**
    *   Donidalorsen, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks, significantly reduced the rate of hereditary angioedema attacks and improved quality of life compared to placebo.
    *   Donidalorsen administered every 8 weeks reduced attack rate, but to a lesser degree than every 4 weeks.
    *   The safety profile was generally favorable.

17. **Strengths and limitations:**
    *   **Strengths:**
        *   The study used a robust, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design.
        *   The study utilized well-established patient-reported outcomes to assess quality of life and disease control.
        *   The primary endpoint, the time-normalized attack rate, was robust and clinically meaningful.
        *   The study showed a reduction in the number of attacks that led to on-demand therapy, which is an important real world measure of treatment effectiveness.
        *   96 % of patients enrolled in the open label extension, which is another patient centered marker of efficacy.
    *   **Limitations:**
        *   The sample size was relatively small due to the rarity of the condition, which limits the generalizability of the findings.
        *  The baseline attack rate was lower in the placebo group compared to the other groups, potentially underestimating the true treatment effect of donidalorsen.
        *   The trial lacked racial diversity among participants.
        *    The study design required a run-in period to establish a baseline attack rate and, therefore, might have missed patients with fewer attacks.
        *   The follow-up period of 25 weeks may not be sufficient to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of donidalorsen.

18. **Overall Quality:**
    *   Excellent. The study used a rigorous design, and the results were clear and clinically relevant. There was a lack of racial diversity and potential bias due to an imbalance in baseline attack rate, but the findings are still generalizable. Small sample size but sufficiently powered to detect a clinically meaningful effect.

19. **Figures and Tables:**
    *   **Figure 1**: The figure shows the mean percent change in the rate of hereditary angioedema attacks from baseline to week 25 in the donidalorsen (4 week and 8 week dosing) and placebo groups, with error bars indicating 95% confidence intervals.
