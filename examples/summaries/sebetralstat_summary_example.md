1. **Declarative Title**: Oral sebetralstat significantly reduces time to symptom relief, reduction in severity, and complete resolution of hereditary angioedema attacks compared to placebo.

2. **Background**:
    *   Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disorder typically caused by mutations in the *SERPING1* gene, which leads to a deficiency (Type 1) or dysfunction (Type 2) of the C1 inhibitor protein.
    *   This deficiency causes uncontrolled activation of the kallikrein-kinin system and an excess of bradykinin, resulting in recurrent episodes of tissue swelling (angioedema) that can be life-threatening if the upper airway is affected.
    *   In contrast, allergic (foods/insect bite) angioedema is associated with histamine but HAE is NOT so antihistamine/steroids/epi donâ€™t work.
    *   Current on-demand treatments for HAE are administered parenterally (e.g., injection, IV), which can cause delays in treatment. This is because these medications often require transport, preparation, and can cause hesitation in patients due to needle-related anxiety. 
    *   Oral treatments for HAE exist for prophylaxis (prevention of attacks) but there are no approved oral therapies for on-demand treatment of acute attacks.
     *   Sebetralstat is an oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor in development for the on-demand treatment of HAE attacks, with prior phase 2 trials showing rapid absorption and nearly complete inhibition of plasma kallikrein within 15 minutes of administration.

5. **Purpose**:
    *   **Population**: Participants 12 years of age or older with type 1 or type 2 hereditary angioedema
    *   **Intervention**: Oral sebetralstat (300 mg or 600 mg)
    *   **Comparison**: Placebo
    *  **Outcome**: Time to the beginning of symptom relief

6.  **Primary predictor variable**:
    *   The primary predictor variable was the administration of sebetralstat at two different doses (300mg and 600mg) compared to placebo, given as an on-demand treatment when the participant had an angioedema attack.

7.  **Primary outcome variable**:
    *   The primary outcome was the beginning of symptom relief, defined as a rating of "a little better" on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale at two or more consecutive time points within 12 hours after the first administration of the trial agent.

8.  **Secondary outcome variables**:
    *   Reduction in attack severity: Defined as an improved rating on the Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) scale at two or more consecutive time points within 12 hours.
     *   Complete attack resolution: Defined as a rating of "none" on the PGI-S scale within 24 hours.

9.  **Study design**:
    *   This was a phase 3, double-blind, three-way crossover trial.
    *   **Double-blind:** Neither the participants nor the researchers knew which treatment (sebetralstat or placebo) the participant was receiving. This reduces bias in reporting of outcomes.
    *   **Randomized:** Participants were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences to ensure equal distribution of known and unknown factors among the treatment arms.
    *   **Crossover:** Each participant received each of the study drugs (300 mg sebetralstat, 600mg sebetralstat and placebo) at different time periods in a pre-defined sequence. This design helps control for inter-individual variability in response by having subjects act as their own controls.
    *  **Placebo-controlled:** The study had a placebo group to compare to the experimental groups. This design allows one to determine whether a treatment effect is due to the active drug or placebo effect.
    *  **Phase 3 Trial**: late-stage clinical trial designed to confirm the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing of a treatment in a larger patient population.

10. **Level of evidence**: 
    *   Level 1B. Therapeutic study. Randomized controlled trial with narrow confidence intervals.

1.  **Methodology**:
    *   **Patient Recruitment:**
        *   Participants were recruited from 53 sites across 17 countries.
        *   Inclusion criteria :
            *   at least 12 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 HAE
            *   at least two documented attacks within 3 months before screening
            *   access to conventional on-demand therapy
            *   If they were on long-term prophylaxis, participants had to have a stable regimen for 3 months prior to screening.
        *   Exclusion Criteria:
            *   taking ACE inhibitors
    *   **Data Collection**:
        *   Data was collected using an electronic diary. Patients recorded attack onset, location, severity, time of medication administration, and use of conventional treatments.
        *   The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) scale was used to assess symptom relief. The PGI-C scale is a 7-point scale that asks patients to rate their current status with respect to a specific condition, using responses such as much worse, worse, a little worse, no change, a little better, better, and much better.
        *  The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) was used to assess severity of symptoms. The PGI-S scale is a 5 point scale ranging from none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe.
        *  These are both subjective patient-reported outcomes that measure how the patient feels about their condition. Although subjective, the PGI-C scale has been validated in other disease settings and is a common outcome measure for clinical trials
    *   **Key Procedures**:
        *   Participants were randomly assigned to one of six sequences to receive up to two oral doses of sebetralstat (300 mg or 600 mg) or placebo for an elligible HAE attack.
        *   Participants were instructed to administer the assigned treatment as early as possible after the start of an HAE attack.
        *   If the attack had not improved sufficiently within 3 hours, a second dose of the assigned treatment could be taken.
        *   Assessments were made every half hour for the first 4 hours, then hourly up to 12 hours, every 2 hours up to 24 hours, and every 12 hours up to 48 hours.
        *   **Eligible attack**: 
            * start of attack identified 
            * at least 48h elapsed since a trial agent or conventional agent was taken for a previous attack 
            * participant able to enter attack info in electronic diary during initial 4h after taking trial agent 
            * Any attack location and severity at baseline (excluding laryngeal attacks that were considered severe)
    *   **Blinding**: A double-dummy method was used to maintain blinding, where all patients received the same number of tablets.

2.  **Statistical Methods**:
    *   The primary and key secondary endpoints were analyzed using a *time-to-event* analysis. Time-to-event analysis is a type of statistical analysis that looks at the time it takes for an event to occur, in this case it was the time to symptom relief, reduction in severity, and complete resolution of the angioedema attack.
        *   This type of analysis is different from analyzing endpoints at single timepoints and is useful when we are interested in the time that it takes for an event to occur.
    *   The *Gehan score transformation* was used in the time-to-event analysis to analyze survival curves. Survival curves are a type of statistical graph used to show the proportion of the study group that have not yet reached the endpoint at a specific time. 
       *   The Gehan-Wilcoxon test or Gehan test is a nonparametric statistical method for comparing two survival curves.
       *   The Gehan test places greater weight on events that occur earlier in the study period, which is helpful if the treatment effect is expected to be more pronounced early on.
   *   Fixed-Sequence, closed-testing procedure was used to control for multiplicity. This is used to control the family-wise error rate ( probability of making at least one Type I error (false positive) among a group of multiple hypothesis tests).  It tests a hierarchy of hypotheses, starting with the global null hypothesis (no effect across all comparisons). If the global null is rejected, testing proceeds to smaller subsets of hypotheses, following a predefined structure. Each hypothesis is tested only if all encompassing (broader) hypotheses have been rejected, ensuring strong error control across all comparisons.
    *   Pairwise comparisons were performed between each dose of sebetralstat and placebo, with a *Bonferroni* correction to account for multiple comparisons.
        *  The Bonferroni correction is a statistical correction that is used when multiple statistical tests are performed on the same dataset to minimize the chance of a false positive (Type I error). In essence, it reduces the threshold for p-value significance by the number of comparisons performed (eg if you have 3 comparisons and you want an overall alpha of 0.05, you would require a p-value of 0.05/3 = 0.0167 to be considered significant).
        *  This was done with a *loopback* feature which allowed for passing of alpha in a two-way fashion, which allows for multiple comparisons while still controlling for overall type-1 error
    *   An *intention-to-treat analysis* was conducted using imputed data for participants who were randomized but did not have any attacks during the trial.
        *  An intention-to-treat analysis includes all randomized patients in the groups to which they were initially assigned, regardless of whether they completed the study, which better reflects real-world scenarios.
         * In an intention-to-treat analysis, missing data must be imputed by a variety of methods, depending on the study.
     *  Treatment failure was defined as the use of conventional treatment before the primary or key secondary endpoints, and these attacks were *right-censored* at the end of the analysis window.
        *  Censoring refers to the instances where the outcome of a participant is unknown (for example, if a patient withdraws from a study and therefore the time to a specific event is not known). In right censoring, the event of interest has not been observed by the end of the observation period.

3.  **Population details**:
    *   A total of 136 participants were enrolled and randomized into the study and 110 participants with 264 total elligible attacks were included in the full analysis population.
    *   The median age was 39.5 years, with an IQR of 25 to 49 years.
    *   40% of participants were male.
    *   83.6% of participants were White, 9.1% were Asian, and 0.9% were Black.
    *   The median time since diagnosis of HAE was 12 years (IQR 7-22).
    *   21.8% of participants were receiving long-term prophylaxis, which included Berotralstat, Lanadelumab, C1 inhibitor replacement or a combination.
    *   The study included participants from Europe, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region.
    *   The demographics and baseline characteristics were similar across the treatment groups.
    *   The median time from attack onset to administration of a trial agent was 41 minutes.
    *  It is worth noting that patients were allowed to self-administer the drug and were able to do so at home. This is unlike prior studies for HAE treatments which required the administration of medications at a clinic. This also makes the results more generalizable as they reflect real world use conditions. 

4.  **Results**:
    *   The time to beginning of symptom relief was significantly faster with both the 300mg (median time 1.61 hours, P<0.001) and 600mg (median time 1.79 hours, P=0.001) doses of sebetralstat compared to placebo (median time 6.72 hours).
    *   The time to reduction in attack severity was significantly faster with both the 300mg (median time 9.27 hours, P=0.004) and 600mg (median time 7.75 hours, P=0.003) doses of sebetralstat compared to placebo (median time >12 hours).
    *   The time to complete resolution was significantly faster with both the 300mg (P=0.002) and 600mg (P<0.001) doses of sebetralstat compared to placebo.
    *   The percentage of attacks with complete resolution within 24 hours was 42.5% with the 300mg dose, 49.5% with the 600mg dose, and 27.4% with placebo.
    *   The treatment effect of sebetralstat was consistent across various subgroups based on attack characteristics, patient characteristics, and geographic location.

5.  **Safety outcomes (if applicable)**:
    *   Sebetralstat and placebo had similar safety profiles, and no serious adverse events related to the trial agents were reported.
    *   Adverse events occurred in 19.8%, 15.1%, and 20.5% of patients who received 300mg sebetralstat, 600mg sebetralstat and placebo, respectively.
    *   Most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (e.g., dyspepsia, nausea), general disorders (fatigue), and nervous system disorders (e.g., headache, dysgeusia).
    *   Three serious adverse events were reported but were not related to the trial agent.

6.  **Key takeaways**:
    *   Oral sebetralstat significantly reduced the time to symptom relief, reduction in severity, and complete resolution of HAE attacks compared to placebo.
    *   Sebetralstat had a similar safety profile to placebo.
    *   Sebetralstat may provide a more convenient and effective option for on-demand treatment of HAE attacks.

7.  **Strengths and limitations**:
    *   **Strengths**:
        *   The study had a robust double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design.
        *   The use of patient-reported outcomes captured the subjective experience of symptom relief and attack severity.
        *   The study was conducted across multiple sites and countries, increasing the generalizability of the results.
        *   The results were consistent across multiple subgroups based on demographic and disease characteristics.
        *  The study included a large sample size, which increased statistical power and allowed for more definitive results.
    *   **Limitations**:
        *   The time intervals between assessments were longer after the first 4 hours, which may have led to some delay in data collection.
        *   Patients receiving certain long-term prophylactic medications were excluded from the trial.
        *   Approximately 19% of the randomized participants were not included in the analysis, although an intention-to-treat analysis was done to account for this missing data.
        * A small number of laryngeal attacks were reported, so the impact of sebetralstat in this population could not be assessed.
        * Lack of racial diversity among participants

8.  **Overall Quality**:
    *   Excellent
    *   The study had a very rigorous methodology, with a robust design that minimized bias. The statistical analysis was appropriate, and the results were consistent and clinically meaningful. The limitations are minor and do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the study.
